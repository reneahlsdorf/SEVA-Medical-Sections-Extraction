## Project Files

As the files of the SEVA publication cannot be shared freely due to their connection to the [MIMIC-III database](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/), you need to place them in this folder once you gained access to the SEVA project on PhysioNet.

> ⚠️ Please place all downloaded files here **except** the `model_<X>.parquet` files.
